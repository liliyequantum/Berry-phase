# Academic work
An experimental scheme for determining the Berry phase in two-dimensional quantum materials with a flat band [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15596]

# Usage direction
1. Here is the data shared on Zenodo [] for the directory data of `data_strong`, `data_weak` under `weak_strong_t_alpha`, and `data_J_t` under `BO_t`. These data can be generated by using `.m` files under `weak_strong_t_alpha` and `BO_t`, respectively. 

2. The file `filter_hexagon_cut_width_0.001_p_x_size_1200_p_y_size_1050.mat` shared on Zenodo should be placed both in `Bloch_t` and `Bloch_alpha` directories.
