# Academic work
An experimental scheme for determining the Berry phase in two-dimensional quantum materials with a flat band. For more details, you can read the full paper on arXiv [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15596]

# Usage direction
1. The data generated from this project is shared on Zenodo. You can access it using the following link: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12575195]
2. The relevant directories are as follows:
   `data_strong` and `data_weak` under `weak_strong_t_alpha`
   `data_J_t` under `BO_t`
   These datasets can be generated using the `.m` files located in the `weak_strong_t_alpha` and `BO_t` directories, respectively.
3. The data `filter_hexagon_cut_width_0.001_p_x_size_1200_p_y_size_1050.mat`, also shared on Zenodo, should be placed in both the `Bloch_t` and `Bloch_alpha directories`.
