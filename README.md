# Berry_phase
An experimental scheme for determining the Berry phase in two-dimensional quantum materials with a flat band

# Usage direction
Data in the `data_strong`, `data_weak`, and `data_J_t` folders can be generated using the same directory of `.m` files. For convenience, the generated data has been shared on Zenodo. You can access it using the following link:
Additionally, the file `filter_hexagon_cut_width_0.001_p_x_size_1200_p_y_size_1050.mat` should be placed in `Bloch_t` and `Bloch_alpha` folders.
